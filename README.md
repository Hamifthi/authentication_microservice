# authentication_microservice
## motivation
I create this project to practice coding clean architecture and new technologies.

## tech stack
I use  Golang, gRPC, GraphQL, Postgres, MongoDB

## project explanation
I try to use both sql and nosql based databases for experiencing challenges involved with both of them.

Because of using clean architecture I'm able to use 3 different technologies which are REST API, gRPC and GraphQL for gateways.

Also, I utilize dependency injection for dependencies which make testing much easier.

I write unit tests for the core logic and use mocking for dependencies of the project.
